    <h3>Role: Programmer/Analyst</h3>

    <p>I was one of many students hired by the university during the summer to prepare resources for the upcoming online
      fall semester. Since I had
      programming experience my role was to prepare code examples and digital notes for upcoming classes.</p>

    <p>The main project I was tasked with was building a form of 'virtual textbook' for CIS*2430, the
      'Object-Oriented Programming' course that every Bachelor of Computing student takes to complete their degree.
      In past years supplementary content was given through a physical textbook and interactive content from a
      third-party
      provider, Zybooks.<br> With the shift to online learning in the upcoming semester, the idea was to create an
      interactive textbook
      consisting of a series of Jupyter Notebook pages, each with interactive code samples that can be edited in real
      time. Students
      could then follow along with the professor as they go through the notes or access them at their own pace.</p>

    <p>Every workday we would have standup meetings via Zoom for co-op students, students with summer research projects
      and faculty
      involved in the project. About once every month we would have a "Show-And-Tell" meeting, where students presented
      the current status
      of the projects they were working on.</p>
    <p>I found the daily standups to be an excellent way of getting an overview on how other's projects are progressing,
      and in getting
      help for blockers your project might face. This was especially important when the majority of communication was
      through asynchronous
      chat and email - synchronous communication is ideal for getting issues immediately addressed.</p>

    <h2 class="mb-5">Tech Stack</h2>
    <p>The programming language used was mostly Java, as that was the object-oriented language chosen for the class.
      Examples for the
      different topics in the course were designed to be fully built and run using Gradle - a build system for Java
      projects, similar to
      what make is for C projects.</p>
    <p>I had used Maven before at previous co-op positions, so I had an idea of what a build tool could do and how it
      they are generally structured. Gradle revolves around a <b>build.gradle</b> file that pulls in plugins, adds
      dependencies and repositories, and defines tasks for building and running the application.</p>
    <img class="codeImg" src="img/carbon.svg" alt="">
    <p><br>In addition to the Java example projects, a main focus of my work was writing <b>Jupyter Notebooks</b> for
      each of
      the topics covered in CIS*2430. Jupyter Notebooks are like a combination of markdown and code - a collection of
      cells
      that can be either markdown prose or code that can be run directly within the document. This combination creates a
      sort of "code narrative" where the markdown explains a concept that is then demonstrated by the code cells.</p>
    <p>Originally developed for scientific computing and analysis applications in Python, Jupyter now supports many
      different languages including Java.</p>

<section class="resume-section p-3 p-lg-5 d-flex justify-content-center" id="goals">
  <div class="w-100">
    <h2 class="mb-5">Goals</h2>
    <div class="goalAnswer">
      <h4><i>Goal 1:</i> Become proficient in using Gradle to build applications</h4>
      <p>It was decided early on that the Java examples and projects I would work on would all use Gradle as a build
        system
        to compile and run the applications. I had used Maven at my previous co-op position, but in a more operational
        role
        as the Maven project had already been built. Gradle is a widely-used build system for Java (being the standard
        build system
        for Android projects for instance), so it is a very useful tool to learn for future roles in Java
        development.</p>
      <p>Gradle can support many different project structures - from a single-entrypoint class to multiple classes with
        main()
        methods running separate programs. Gradle can efficiently run multi-project structures as well - have a <i>build.gradle</i>
        for each project and a root <i>settings.gradle</i> file that connects all of the build files together. All of
        the tasks in
        each project build file can then be run from the <i>settings.gradle</i> location. I built every Java project to
        be built and run
        using Gradle, including projects with external dependencies like JUnit and Lanterna.</p>
      <p>Gradle can be installed manually (via package manager tools like apt) but a cool feature of Gradle is <i>wrapper
        files</i>,
        named <i>gradlew</i> or <i>gradlew.bat</i> respectively for the different shell systems. If a project has a
        Gradle
        wrapper file, you run Gradle commands using that wrapper file (ex. <code>./gradlew build</code> )and it will
        automatically
        download and run a local verison of Gradle for you, no manual installation required! This makes getting up and
        running
        with Gradle projects as a new user very easy.</p>
      <p>I consider this goal achieved as I have a solid understanding of both setting up a Gradle build for different
        project
        scenarios and running Gradle builds from the command-line. Next steps would be to learn how to use Gradle for
        more advanced
        processes like running CI builds or advanced testing scenarios. Gradle scripts can also be written in Kotlin
        which would
        be an interesting avenue to explore and could lead to more Kotlin development.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="goalAnswer">
      <h4><i>Goal 2:</i> Learn Java Design Patterns</h4>
      <p>I made this goal when I learned I would do most of my work in Java - object-oriented languages benefit from
        modular
        design patterns that promote flexible, reusable code.</p>
      <p>The projects I worked on - preparing practice problems and Jupyter Notebooks for course topics - does not
        naturally
        lead to implementing Design Patterns, so I worked to include them into my role. I designed Jupyter Notebooks
        that would
        introduce a Design Pattern, explain why it was useful, and provide examples in Java that were relevant to the
        course project
        students would work on.</p>
      <p>The patterns I focused on were the <i>Factory Method, Singleton, Decorator and Strategy</i> patterns. Each have
        their
        own approach to making code structure flexible and easy to work with.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>The <b>Factory Method</b> pattern allows you to decide at runtime what subclass type you want to
          instantiate</p></li>
        <li><p>The <b>Singleton</b> pattern creates a class with one (and only one) instance active at a time, globally
          accessed
          by other classes.</p></li>
        <li><p>The <b>Decorator</b> pattern allows you to layer additional effects and attributes onto a base class
          implementation.
          Think of it like decorating a tree - you start with a base tree, then you layer on whatever additional
          ornaments and effects
          you want the individual tree to have.</p></li>
        <li><p>The <b>Strategy</b> pattern provides a collection of methods that can be freely interchanged with
          different
          implementations. While quite similar to the Decorator pattern, the difference is that with the Strategy
          pattern you
          completely swap out method implementations, while with Decorator you are adding details on top of a base
          implementation.</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p>I believe I accomplished what a set out to achieve with this goal - I learned the mechanics behind multiple
        common
        design patterns and applied them in code examples. I think learning design patterns from the perspective of
        having to explain
        them to other students was useful in understanding both the mechanics and why you would want to use design
        patterns. Some next
        steps for this goal would be to apply design patterns in a project setting, rather than as isolated code
        examples.</p>

      <h4><i>Goal 3:</i> Learn to effectively present / introduce projects</h4>
      <p>This was a continuation of a goal a set last work term; I found that when attempting to introduce or explain
        technical
        topics I was often unclear or took a long time to get an idea across. As I was doing solo work on multiple
        projects
        this work term, I thought it would be good practice to present my progress on these projects as much as possible
        to build
        experience and confidence.</p>
      <p>I had plenty of opportunities to present my work to others. Every workday the team would have virtual standup
        meetings, where
        we would be broken off into random groups to discuss our progress. Since each standup would have a different
        group of people
        than the last one, I made an effort to introduce and explain the projects I was working on - both so my group
        would have context
        and so I could get valuable practice.</p>
      <p>Once every month the team would have a "Show and Tell" meeting where we would present what we were working on
        over
        the summer. These meetings were an excellent opportunity to practice technical and presentation speaking, and I
        used them
        as a judge for if I was improving or not. At the first meeting I presented the Jupyter Notebooks I had been
        created
        for CIS*2430, and at the second meeting I presented a proof-of-concept of making a Roguelike game using the
        Lanterna
        terminal library.</p>
      <p>I found that creating a rough bullet-point 'script' to follow when demoing my work was really helpful in
        keeping me
        on track and providing a logical flow to my presentation. I created a bullet-point script for my Lanterna
        presentation
        and I found it was much clearer than my first presentation, where I went without a script.</p>

    <h2 class="mb-5">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This work term was a much different experience than my previous one. Whereas my previous work term was working
      closely
      with an Agile team on business software, this work term was mainly independent, self-driven work on educational
      content.
      Design details were largely left for me to determine, which really forced me to have a concrete method of planning
      work
      and designing my project structure. I had walked into an existing design structure in my previous placement, so
      coming up
      with my own was a challenge, but also highlighted how important planning really was to the development
      process.</p>
    <p>The fact that the entire work term was done remotely was also a major change. Initiative and self-motivation are
      really important to getting work done remotely, even more so than working in-person where there are more
      reinforcement
      mechanisms in place (eg. Peers/supervisors becoming aware of your distraction).</p>
    <p>Overall this work term provided a lot of insight into how course content is created, and a lot of experience in
      independent,
      self-driven work - both of which are valuable going forward!</p>
